About the Project
------------------
-The project works as specified, and does all the
ray tracing
-Extra Credit: I implemented antialiasing via
supersampling. However, since it takes so long, 
I defaulted the program to not do that. To change
the program to do antialiasing, you have to change
#define MINIPIXELS (Line 35). This is where it 
specifies how much to split each pizel by 
(i.e. 2 = 2x2 supersampling). By default it is set
to 1, so there is no antialiasing. I have provided an
example of the antialiasing in one of my animation stills
